This is an end-of-year programming project. 
The goal is to create a working tower-defense-type game.
As of now, the game seems to be working, although there might be some cosmetic changes coming up.
The code lacks comments, they will be added shortly so that a new commer can understand this code.
The game consists of 3 level, each varying in difficulty, yet I am still in the phase of balancing the levels.
I hope you enjoy my game.
